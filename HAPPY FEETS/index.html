    ðŸ‘žðŸ‘Ÿ</h1>
    <h3>The average moderately active person take around 7,500 step/day.
        <br>
If you maintain that daily average
<br>
and live until 80 years of age,
<br>
youâ€™ll have walked about 2.16 cr steps in your lifetime.
<br>
Doing the math;the average person with the average stride living 
<br>
until 80 will walk a distance of around 110,000 miles.            
<br>
Which is the equivalent of walking about 5 times around the Earth, right on the equator.
<br>

<br>
If we walk so much we need to take care of our feet and make walking a happy experience
<br>
Do you know ?
<br>
Our feet also have emotions

Nervousness, stress, fear, anxiety, caution, boredom, 
restlessness, happiness, joy, hurt, shyness, coyness,
humility, awkwardness, confidence, subservience, depression, lethargy, playfulness,
sensuality, and anger
can all manifest through the feet and legs.

                         ON MY WAY I FOUND A KID WALKING WITH <i>NO SHOES </i>AND HIS FEET WERE BLEEDING.
                        <br>
                        I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY FATHER AND HE BOUGHT HIM SOME SLIPPERS AND BAND AIDS.
